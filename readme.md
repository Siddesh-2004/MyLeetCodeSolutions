This repository contains my solutions to various LeetCode problems that I’ve solved while practicing data structures and algorithms.
The main goal is to improve my problem-solving skills and keep track of my learning progress.

📘 About

Each file represents a problem I’ve worked on from LeetCode.
The solutions are written with clarity in mind and focus on understanding the logic behind each problem.

Most of the code is in C++, and I’ll keep updating the repository as I solve more problems.

🎯 Purpose

This repository serves as:

A record of my learning journey

A place to review and improve my solutions over time

A small step toward becoming better at coding interviews

📅 Updates

I’ll continue adding new solutions as I practice regularly.
